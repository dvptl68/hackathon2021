Haven is an app to help people in need find resources.

Haven connects people to resources such as food pantries, homeless shelters, healthcare, phone hotlines, and more.

We made this app to serve people in need. The past year and a half, many people have been out of work and we wanted to find a way to help them get back on their feet or just to receive som much-needed care.

We initialized state-of-the-art APIs to fetch data not only locally, but nationally. So if you need food, we'll direct you to the best food banks nearby, but if you need 24/7 hotline support, we also have you covered.
